The Requiem Lyrics
"Cursed"

Maybe I'll never get too far
But I hope some day that all this will make sense (Make sense)
And maybe I'm just a dog chasing cars
And all the lights that I follow lead me into the dark (The dark)

But I'm still running
I'm still running, I'm still running after you
And I'll be holding
I'm still holding on 'til I break apart in two

Maybe I never get too close
Always out of focus fading into the crowd (Into the crowd)
And maybe I've been wrong this whole time
And they were right all along
Maybe I've been hiding from the truth
And I was born to rise

But I'm still running
I'm still running, I'm still running after you
And I'll be holding
I'm still holding on 'til I break apart in two

I'm so far away
From where I want to be
And every day is the same
As the years go by
I hope that there's a smile on my face when I die
Yeah

And I'm still running
I'm still running, I'm still running after you
And I'll be holding
I'm still holding on 'til I break apart in two

Every day, every day's the same
Every day, every day's the same
Every day, every day's the same
Every day, every day's the same
