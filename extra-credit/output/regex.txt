The
Requiem
Lyrics
Cursed
Maybe
never
get
too
far
But
hope
some
day
that
all
this
will
make
sense
Make
sense
And
maybe
just
dog
chasing
cars
And
all
the
lights
that
follow
lead
into
the
dark
The
dark
But
still
running
still
running
still
running
after
you
And
holding
still
holding
til
break
apart
two
Maybe
never
get
too
close
Always
out
focus
fading
into
the
crowd
Into
the
crowd
And
maybe
been
wrong
this
whole
time
And
they
were
right
all
along
Maybe
been
hiding
from
the
truth
And
was
born
rise
But
still
running
still
running
still
running
after
you
And
holding
still
holding
til
break
apart
two
far
away
From
where
want
And
every
day
the
same
the
years
hope
that
there
smile
face
when
die
Yeah
And
still
running
still
running
still
running
after
you
And
holding
still
holding
til
break
apart
two
Every
day
every
day
the
same
Every
day
every
day
the
same
Every
day
every
day
the
same
Every
day
every
day
the
same
